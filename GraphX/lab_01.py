print("\n🎯 What is Graph Processing?")
print("   📊 Graphs = Nodes (vertices) + Edges (connections)")
print("   👥 Examples: People connected by friendships")
print("   🌐 Examples: Websites connected by links") 
print("   💰 Examples: Bank accounts connected by transactions")

print(f"\n🚀 Key GraphX Concepts:")
concepts = """
📍 Vertex/Node: Individual entity (person, webpage, account)
🔗 Edge: Connection between vertices (friendship, link, transaction)  
🏷️ Properties: Data attached to vertices/edges (name, weight, timestamp)
📐 Directed vs Undirected: One-way vs two-way connections
🔄 Graph Algorithms: PageRank, Connected Components, Triangle Count
"""
print(concepts)

print(f"\n🛠️ What You'll Learn:")
learning_outcomes = """
✅ Create graphs from real data
✅ Apply powerful graph algorithms  
✅ Find important nodes and connections
✅ Detect communities and clusters
✅ Build recommendation systems
✅ Identify fraud and anomalies
✅ Scale to millions of nodes/edges
"""
print(learning_outcomes)

print(f"\n📊 Real-World Applications:")
applications = """
🌐 Social Networks: Find influencers, suggest friends
💰 Financial: Detect money laundering, risk analysis  
🛒 E-commerce: Product recommendations, customer segmentation
🚗 Transportation: Route optimization, traffic analysis
🏥 Healthcare: Disease spread, drug interactions
🔒 Cybersecurity: Network intrusion detection
"""
