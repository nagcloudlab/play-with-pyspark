📍 MEMORY_ONLY          - Fastest, but data lost if memory full
📍 MEMORY_AND_DISK      - Recommended default (memory + disk backup)
📍 MEMORY_ONLY_SER      - Memory efficient (serialized)
📍 MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER  - Best for large datasets
📍 DISK_ONLY            - When memory is very limited
📍 Replication levels   - For fault tolerance (production)
